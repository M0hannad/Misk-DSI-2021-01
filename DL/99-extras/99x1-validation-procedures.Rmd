```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
ggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_minimal())
```

In this notebook, we are going to continue using our Ames Housing regression
data focused on predicting home sales prices. However, our focus in this
notebook is to illustrate:

* Variability in model performance will exists for two reasons
* How to apply different validation procedures 

# Package requirements

```{r load-pkgs, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(keras)     # for deep learning
library(testthat)  # unit testing
library(tidyverse) # for dplyr, ggplot2, etc.
library(rsample)   # for data splitting
library(recipes)   # for feature engineering
```


# The Ames housing dataset

For this case study we will use the [Ames housing dataset](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf) 
provided by the __AmesHousing__ package.

```{r get-data, warning=FALSE}
ames <- AmesHousing::make_ames()
dim(ames)
```

# Create train & test splits

Let's create our own training and testing samples, which we can do with the 
rsample package.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
ames_split <- initial_split(ames, prop = 0.7)
ames_train <- analysis(ames_split)
ames_test <- assessment(ames_split)

dim(ames_train)
dim(ames_test)
```


# Preparing the data

The first thing we need to do is prepare our data by:

- removing any zero-variance (or near zero-variance) features
- condensing unique levels of categorical features to "other"
- ordinal encoding the quality features
- normalize numeric feature distributions
- standardizing numeric features to mean = 0, std dev = 1
- one-hot encoding remaining categorical features

This is the same procedure we used in the [first case study](https://misk-data-science.github.io/misk-dl/notebooks/03-mini-project-ames.nb.html).

```{r}
blueprint <- recipe(Sale_Price ~ ., data = ames_train) %>%
  step_nzv(all_nominal()) %>%
  step_other(all_nominal(), threshold = .01, other = "other") %>%
  step_integer(matches("(Qual|Cond|QC|Qu)$")) %>%
  step_YeoJohnson(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes()) %>%
  step_center(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes()) %>%
  step_scale(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes()) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes(), one_hot = TRUE)

prepare <- prep(blueprint, training = ames_train)

baked_train <- bake(prepare, new_data = ames_train)
baked_test <- bake(prepare, new_data = ames_test)

# unit testing to ensure all columns are numeric
expect_equal(map_lgl(baked_train, ~ !is.numeric(.)) %>% sum(), 0)
expect_equal(map_lgl(baked_test, ~ !is.numeric(.)) %>% sum(), 0)

baked_train
```

Next, we create our features and labels dataset for training and testing
purposes.

```{r}
x_train <- select(baked_train, -Sale_Price) %>% as.matrix()
y_train <- baked_train %>% pull(Sale_Price)

x_test <- select(baked_test, -Sale_Price) %>% as.matrix()
y_test <- baked_test %>% pull(Sale_Price)

# unit testing to x & y tensors have same number of observations
expect_equal(nrow(x_train), length(y_train))
expect_equal(nrow(x_test), length(y_test))
```

Our final feature set now has 188 input variables:

```{r}
dim(x_train)
dim(x_test)
```

# Two identical models

Let's create two models that have the exact same architecture, compilation, and
training attributes:

```{r}
# First model
model1_results <- keras_model_sequential() %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 1024, activation = "relu", input_shape = ncol(x_train)) %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 512, activation = "relu") %>%
  layer_dense(units = 1) %>% 
  compile(
    optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop(lr = 0.01),
    loss = "msle",
    metrics = c("mae")
  ) %>% 
  fit(
    x_train,
    y_train,
    batch_size = 32,
    epochs = 50,
    validation_split = 0.2,  # supply our validation data
    callbacks = list(
          callback_early_stopping(patience = 10, restore_best_weights = TRUE),
          callback_reduce_lr_on_plateau(factor = 0.2, patience = 4)
      )
)

# Second model
model2_results <- keras_model_sequential() %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 1024, activation = "relu", input_shape = ncol(x_train)) %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 512, activation = "relu") %>%
  layer_dense(units = 1) %>% 
  compile(
    optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop(lr = 0.01),
    loss = "msle",
    metrics = c("mae")
  ) %>% 
  fit(
    x_train,
    y_train,
    batch_size = 32,
    epochs = 50,
    validation_split = 0.2,  # supply our validation data
    callbacks = list(
          callback_early_stopping(patience = 10, restore_best_weights = TRUE),
          callback_reduce_lr_on_plateau(factor = 0.2, patience = 4)
      )
)
```

You will notice that our results slightly differ. This is because we have 
variability within our model. 

```{r}
# Model 1 results
model1_results

# Model 2 results
model2_results
```

This variability is a result of our model weights being randomly initialized. 
And since the weights in our two models have different starting points, the 
gradient descent process will result in the final weights differing as well. For
larger datasets, the variability in your final results will often be negligible.

However, for smaller datasets, this variability can be greater and can also lead
to skewed inferences. Typically, for tabular datasets less than 10,000 observations,
I will often perform k-fold cross validation to have a more robust understanding 
of variability in the loss score. [ℹ️](https://misk-data-science.github.io/misk-homl/docs/02-modeling-process.nb.html#resampling_methods).

# Validation procedures

To demonstrate how to perform k-fold cross validation, let's first discuss 
another way to perform validation within the `keras::fit()` function. So far we 
have performed model validation by using `validation_split`. Sometimes this may 
not be appropriate. `validation_split` selects the last XX% samples in the x and 
y data provided. So, if our data is ordered than this could skew our results.  

An alternative is to create our own validation data and supply it via 
`validation_data`. First we extract our own train vs. validation data sets:

```{r create-validation}
set.seed(123)
index <- sample(1:nrow(x_train), size = floor(nrow(x_train) * 0.8))

x_train_sub <- x_train[index,]
y_train_sub <- y_train[index]

x_val <- x_train[-index,]
y_val <- y_train[-index]

length(y_train_sub)
length(y_val)
```

Now, we can supply our validation data to `validation_data`. Note how we supply
our validation features and labels datasets as a list to `validation_data`.

```{r train-with-validation}
network <- keras_model_sequential() %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 1024, activation = "relu", input_shape = ncol(x_train)) %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 512, activation = "relu") %>%
  layer_dense(units = 1) %>%
  compile(
    optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop(lr = 0.01),
    loss = "msle",
    metrics = c("mae")
  )

history <- network %>% fit(
  x_train_sub,                           # supply our new training features data
  y_train_sub,                           # supply our new training labels data
  epochs = 50,
  batch_size = 32,
  validation_data = list(x_val, y_val),  # supply our validation data
  callbacks = list(
        callback_early_stopping(patience = 10, restore_best_weights = FALSE),
        callback_reduce_lr_on_plateau(factor = 0.2, patience = 5)
    )
)
```

```{r validation-model-performance}
history
```


# k-fold cross validation

As the number of observations in our data increases, variance in our loss score 
will decrease. However, we do not always have the option to just go out and get 
more data. So, if we want to gain a more accurate understanding of the loss score 
and its variance we can perform _k-fold cross validation_. 

First, we need to create k folds. This example creates 10 folds by dividing the
randomly sampled index into 10 approximately equal "cuts". Consequently, `folds`
in this example is simply a vector that is equal length to our training
observations; stating that observation 1 is assigned to the 10th fold, observation
2 is assigned to the 3rd fold, observation 3 is assigned to the 1st fold, etc.

```{r create-folds}
# number of folds
k <- 10

# randomize data before making folds
set.seed(123)
indices <- sample(1:nrow(x_train))

# divide the ordered indices into k intervals, labeled 1:k.
folds <- cut(indices, breaks = k, labels = FALSE)
str(folds)
```

If we look at all the folds, we'll see that we have nearly equal number of
observations across all folds:

```{r}
table(folds)
```

Now we can apply a `for` loop to iterate through the training data and perform 
k-fold cross validation. This works by:

1. Assigning fold `i` to the validation set and the remaining folds to the
training set,
2. Training our model using `validation_data` to supply our validation set,
3. Save our results for that iteration,
4. Repeat for all 10 folds.

As this code executes, the minimum validation loss score will be printing out
for each fold and you will see the variability across the folds.

```{r perform-kfold-cv}
# create a data frame to store results
results <- data.frame()

for (i in seq_len(k)) {
  cat("processing fold", paste0(i, ": "))
  
  # Prepare the training and validation data for each fold
  val_indices <- which(folds == i, arr.ind = TRUE) 
  
  # validation set: the ith partition
  x_val <- x_train[val_indices,]
  y_val <- y_train[val_indices]
  
  # Training set: all other partitions
  x_train_sub <- x_train[-val_indices,]
  y_train_sub <- y_train[-val_indices]
  
  # Create our model blueprint
  network <- keras_model_sequential() %>% 
    layer_dense(units = 1024, activation = "relu", input_shape = ncol(x_train)) %>% 
    layer_dense(units = 512, activation = "relu") %>%
    layer_dense(units = 1) %>%
    compile(
      optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop(lr = 0.01),
      loss = "msle",
      metrics = c("mae")
    )

  # Train our model with and supply train / validation data
  history <- network %>% fit(
    x_train_sub,                          
    y_train_sub,                           
    epochs = 50,
    batch_size = 32,
    validation_data = list(x_val, y_val),
    verbose = FALSE,
    callbacks = callback_reduce_lr_on_plateau(factor = 0.2, patience = 5)
    )
   
  # Extract the performance data            
  model_performance <- as.data.frame(history) %>% mutate(fold = i)
  results <- rbind(results, model_performance)
  
  # append loop message with min loss for ith fold
  min_loss <- round(min(history$metrics$val_loss), 4)
  cat(min_loss, "\n", append = TRUE)
} 
```

We can plot the results; however, the difference between each folds validation
loss score is not obvious.

```{r plot-kfold-results, message=FALSE}
ggplot(results, aes(epoch, value, color = data)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~ metric, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y")
```

But if we zoom in on the validation loss we can see the variance that exists:

```{r plot-kfold-val-results, message=FALSE}
results %>%
  filter(data == 'validation', metric == 'loss') %>%
  ggplot(aes(epoch, value)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot", colour = "red") +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_y_log10()
```

If we pick the epoch with the lowest ___average___ validation loss, we can see 
that our validation loss is about... 

```{r, message=FALSE}
# which epic has lowest avg loss
best_epoch <- results %>%
  group_by(epoch) %>%
  filter(metric == 'loss', data == 'validation') %>%
  summarise(avg_loss = mean(value), 
            std_loss = sd(value)) %>%
  top_n(-1, wt = avg_loss)

best_epoch
```

If we re-train our model and use the best epoch, we should see similar results 
within reason when scoring on new data:

```{r train-evaluate}
network <- keras_model_sequential() %>%
  layer_dense(units = 1024, activation = "relu", input_shape = ncol(x_train)) %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 512, activation = "relu") %>%
  layer_dense(units = 1) %>%
  compile(
    optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop(lr = 0.01),
    loss = "msle",
    metrics = c("mae")
  )

history <- network %>% fit(
  x_train,                             
  y_train,                             
  epochs = best_epoch$epoch,
  batch_size = 32,
  validation_split = 0.2,
  callbacks = callback_reduce_lr_on_plateau(factor = 0.2, patience = 5),
  verbose = FALSE
  )
```

```{r}
network %>% evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose = FALSE)
```
